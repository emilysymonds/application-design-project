UAV is an application that manages the creation and simulation of drones. 
New drone parts can be created as well as reusable components made up by other parts or components. 
A flight simulation can be executed for each drone in order to evaluate its behaviour towards certain alarms set for each sensor.
The simulation ends when the drone reaches its destination or if an alarm was on for more than 5 seconds.
A simulation report is generated after each simulation.

Design patterns used:

Singleton
Composite
Observer
